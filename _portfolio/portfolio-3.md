title: "The contagious analysis of Preferential Attachment and Small-world networks based on the SIR model"
excerpt: "The number of confirmed and suspected cases in many European countries has risen rapidly since the outbreak of the new coronavirus. At present, no good treatment measures have been found, how to take effective preventive and control measures quickly is still an urgent task. Based on the infectious disease dynamics SIR model, this study studies the rate of spread of different intensity prevention and control measures in the two network models and provides suggestions for the policy makers of a new round of prevention and control strategies.<br/>![SIR](/images/sir.gif){: .align-center}"

## Introduction

The public announcement of the outbreak of Coronavirus, 2019-nCov, Covid-19, NCP, SARS-Cov-2 on January 21, 2019, followed by the release of a large number of outbreak data showed the seriousness of the spread of the epidemic and caused a high degree of 20 world concern. Since then, a series of outbreak control measures, such as strengthening medical treatment, isolation, strengthening medical resources, research and treatment methods and vaccines, as well as later city closure and other prevention and control strategies, are related to the future development of the epidemic. At present, the epidemic is still developing, the national rescue and control operations are being carried out on a larger scale, the future trend forecast of the development of the epidemic is also playing a key role in the control of the epidemic on a larger scale. The epidemic spread model of infectious diseases is a traditional epidemiological and mathematical problem, which has important practical value. In recent years, the frequent outbreaks of large-scale outbreaks around the world have aroused the high attention of academic circles and all sectors of society to the transmission model and its application, and there have been some innovations in methods, which have played an important role in epidemic control, rescue operations, resource allocation, transportation, travel planning and so on. In the world's intellectual city construction and other technological innovation activities, combined with the core functions of the city to carry out research on the spread of infectious diseases model, can deepen the digital city model, improve the management level, improve emergency response capacity, is an important content of urban construction and development. This research can be based on the continuous maturity, combined with the future model of urban and social development, to improve the level of urban emergency management, to ensure the ultimate realization of the sustainable development goals of mankind.

## Methodology

Infectious diseases are a long-standing social and natural phenomenon that has become a turning point or a trigger point for some important changes in human history. It is for these reasons that the model of the spread of infectious diseases is also familiar to us and one of the important achievements of mankind in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. As a social phenomenon, many assumptions are usually made in research, but their effectiveness and rationality have been proven and play an important role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases worldwide today. Here we use the simplest possible model to meet current rapid estimates of the number of infections and overall trends in outbreaks, to help develop accurate patient assistance measures and outbreak control strategy studies.
