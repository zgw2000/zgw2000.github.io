**SATS 101 (Introduction to Applied Statistical Methods) Teaching Assistant _[Software R]_**

üìå Answered statistical questions and the syntax error of R for undergraduate students with daily office hours per week.

üìå Assisted professors in grading undergraduate assignments and exams. Taught and guided them for ambiguous questions.

What is this course about?
======
Introduction to Applied Statistical Methods (STATS 101) is about introducing students to the ‚Äúworld‚Äù of data and how to use those data to answer questions that interest them. For example, what causes war? Why do certain group of people vote for a certain candidate over the other candidate? What makes a certain countries rich and others poor? To answer these questions, we will examine several empirical data and determine whether we can make valid conclusions from the information contain in those data.

Objective
======
The goal of this course is to get you familiarize with basic statistical methods and to help you understand the basic logic of quantitative works in various disciplines in social science. Finally, the course does not emphasize on the mathematical formulas related to statistics. Instead, the emphasis is centered onthe practical applications of statistics.
