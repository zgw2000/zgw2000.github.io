🎓 I'm a final year graduate student at Duke University (Pratt School of Engineering) majoring Computer Engineering.

👍🏻 I am good at Data Structure & algorithm, Java & C/C++ OO design, Python (Machine Learning) and Economic Analysis.

👨🏻‍🏫 As a undergraduate teaching assistant at Duke University, Answered statistical questions and the syntax error of R and Assisted professors in grading undergraduate assignments and exams.
🤖👍🏻👋🏻👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍🏫🧢🎯⚙️🔬📍📌🇨🇳🇮🇹🇺🇸

🧢 My background is diverse. I attended Dearborn Elementary Academy in Los Angeles for six months as a visiting scholar with my parents at California State. The rest of my education took place in Beijing, China. During my undergraduate studies, I pursued degrees in Management and Computer Science at LUISS University in Rome, Italy, under the guidance of Italian computer scientist Giuseppe Francesco (Pino) Italiano. In the fall of 2022, I enrolled in Duke University Pratt School of Engineering to continue my studies in Computer Science.

⚙️ I have extensive experience in creating projects, where I handled both frontend and backend development while also designing the UI. Moreover, I have a strong passion for writing high-quality code and test cases.

👨🏻‍💻 As a Software Engineer intern at Mevion Medical Systems, I played a pivotal role in developing the Room 3D View feature at Mevion. I successfully addressed display issues, improved user experience, and ensured safe movement of the treatment bed. I researched collision detection techniques, collaborated cross-functionally, and implemented effective solutions. My contributions enhanced the user interface and facilitated seamless navigation. I am proud of my work on Room 3D functionality and look forward to leveraging my expertise in future projects. Let's connect to discuss how I can bring value to your organization.

👨🏻‍💻 As a Artificial Intelligence Developer intern intern at Bank of Beijing Fintech, I Collected user text data with intelligence robot assistant from application API. Constructed various Natural language processing (NLP) algorithm models, parameters tuning and uploaded them to the Docker warehouse to help the project. I also Scrapped hundreds of pages of data from Beijing Municipal Health Commission with a Scrapy framework into database.
